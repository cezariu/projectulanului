[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]WHILE RUNNING THE DUNGEON

[X_PADDING=12;COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]FIRST PHASE
[X_PADDING=20]As a first goal, players will have to inflict damage to statues in the room until they reach 75% of their HP. 
[X_PADDING=20]The group will be blocked by the spawn of numerous mobs throughout the duration of this phase.
[X_PADDING=20]When a statue loses 25% of HP, it changes colour and can no longer be damaged.
[X_PADDING=20]When all the statues change colour, stage 2 will start. 
[X_PADDING=20]During this transition the mobs in the room will disappear and you will not be able to interact with the Statues.

[X_PADDING=12;COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]SECOND PHASE
[X_PADDING=20]At this phase, Statues will have to hit the statues again, until they reach 50% of their HP.
[X_PADDING=20]This time, the group of players will be blocked by the spawn of a larger number of mobs and, moreover,
[X_PADDING=20]Eggs guarantee immunity to damage to the Statues, therefore, hp of the statues can onl be reduced when no eggs are present. 
[X_PADDING=20]Once the 50% of HP's Statues reach, once again, they will become indestructible. 
[X_PADDING=20]When all the Statues change color again, you will go to phase 3.

[X_PADDING=12;COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]THIRD PHASE
[X_PADDING=20]At this stage you will still need to hit Statues until the HP runs out. The same Eggs of the previous phase will appear, 
[X_PADDING=20]an even bigger number of mobs and four Dragon Watcher Idall . These mobs must be eliminated before
[X_PADDING=20]the end of this phase, otherwise it will not be possible to end the run. As on the previous stage, if there are Eggs in the room, 
[X_PADDING=20]Statues can not be damaged. When Statues reach 0% of HP, they will become blue. At this point you will have to destroy the
[X_PADDING=20]Statues by dragging them over a Dragonfire Ring, dropped by dungeon monsters.
[X_PADDING=20]Each player can destroy only one Statue. Once you drag the Ring, the Statue becomes green:
[X_PADDING=20]Statue becomes green: the third stage will end when all the statues change color.

[X_PADDING=12;COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]FOURTH PHASE
[X_PADDING=20]As each stage ends, the Statues will attack Meley: the third phase will end the statues will inflict the last blow and Meley
[X_PADDING=20]will flee. Players will now be able to receive their reward by interacting with the NPC Golden Dragon Chest.
[X_PADDING=20]After completion of this prison any participant can choose one of the 2 chests: Queen Meley's Chest and Dragon Watcher Chest
